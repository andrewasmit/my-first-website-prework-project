      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a former music teacher turned software engineer. I spent 9 years in
        the classroom teaching grades 6-12 before deciding to take my skills
        into a new career field. I have always been a lifelong learner and I am
        eager to continue that into the world of coding.

      <h2>My Music Career--> My Coding Career</h2>
      <p id="compositions-about">
        In addition to teaching music in public schools, I am a published
        composer. I have several pieces of music published with two reputable
        publishing companies;
        <a href="https://c-alanpublications.com/" target="_blank">C-Alan Publications</a> and
        <a href="https://www.tapspace.com/" target="_blank">Tapspace Publications.</a> There are
        several reasons I feel this info is relevant to my career as a software
        engineer.
      </p>
      <ul id="composition-reasons">
        <li>
          The process of publishing a complete work proves I have the knowledge,
          skill, and determination to see a project through from its ideal
          conception all the way through its public release
        </li>
        <li>
          The publication process also proves my ability and willingness to
          collaborate with a team of people invested in putting a final product
          out into the world to be used by the public
        </li>
        <li>
          The range of difficulty levels throughout my compositions serve a
          larger spectrum of performers, showcasing my abiltity to recognize a
          need and implement a user-friendly experience in addressing that need

            that seek to provide the percussion community with solos at an
            approachable difficulty-level. With few exceptions, the market for
            music on this instrumnet is far too advanced for beginner or
            intermediate percussionists.

            is my attempt at providing engaging music that requires a small
            arsenal of rhythms. This also has an optional part so there is even
            more flexibility with ensembles ability to play the piece.
