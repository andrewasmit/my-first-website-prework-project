      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a former music teacher turned software engineer. I spent 9 years in
        the classroom teaching grades 6-12 before deciding to take my skills
        into a new career field. I have always been a lifelong learner and I am
        eager to continue that into the world of coding.
      </p>
      <p id="compositions-about">
        In addition to teaching music in public schools, I am a published
        composer. I have several pieces of music published with two reputable
        publishing companies;
        <a href="https://c-alanpublications.com/">C-Alan Publications</a> and
        <a href="https://www.tapspace.com/">Tapspace Publications.</a> There are several reasons I feel this info is relevant to my career as a software engineer. 
        <ul>
          <li>All of my compositions serve a need in the community that needed addressing</li>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwUETmmisKY">"June Bug"</a>is a beginner-level marimba solo that seeks to provide the performer with a song that sounds interesting, but still addresses the minimal mastery of 4-mallet technique</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-M1Cu8S_28">"A Tribe Called Quads"</a>is a collection of 8 solos all ranging from beginner to advanced that seek to provide the percussion community with solos at an approachable difficulty-level. With few exceptions, the market for music on this instrumnet is far too advanced for beginner or intermediate percussionists.</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.tapspace.com/percussion-ensemble/final-boss-the">"The Final Boss"</a> is my attempt at providing engaging music that requires a small arsenal of rhythms. This also has an optional part so there is even more flexibility with ensembles ability to play the piece.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The range of difficulty levels throughout my compositions serve a larger spectrum of students and performers</li>
          <li>The process of publishing a complete work proves I have the knowledge, skill, and determination to see a project through from conception to publication</li>
          <li>The publication process also proves my ability and willingness to collaborate with a team of people invested in putting a final product out into the world to be used by the public </li>
        </ul>
